Welcome to my new DBT project!

# Description
[![3.1M Records 1.2GB](https://img.shields.io/badge/3.1M_Records-1.2GB-1DA1F2)](https://www.gharchive.org/) 

This project uses DBT to analyze over 3 million events recorded by developers around the world on public GitHub repositories on April 16, 2023. The data was collected from the GitHub API and stored in a Snowflake database. DBT was used to transform the data into a more structured format and to generate analytical insights.
